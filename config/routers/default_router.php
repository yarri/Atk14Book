/**
 * Here is the list of routes (URIs) to controllers and their actions. Routes are
 * considered in order - the first matching route will be used.
 * 
 * There are four generic routes at the end of the list. If you don't have any extra
 * needs, these four routes are enough for you.
 *
 * Search engine friendly URIs can be also defined here. Consider to setup SEF URIs
 * at the end of the development or at least not at the beginning.
 * 
 * In your templates build links always this way
 *
 *      {a controller=creatures action=detail id=$creature}Details of the creature{/a}
 *
 * According to the matching generic route, the following URI will be rendered
 *
 *      /en/creatures/detail/?id=123
 *
 * Now you can prepend a SEF route like this
 *
 *      $this->addRoute("/creature-<id>/","creatures/detail",array("id" => "/[0-9]+/"));
 *
 * the previous link will be changed automatically to the following one
 *
 *      /creature-123/
 *
 * Keep in mind that there is a useful script for URI recognition
 *
 *      $ ./scripts/recognize_route http://myapp.localhost/creature-123/
 *
 * For more information about routing see http://book.atk14.net/czech/routing/
